The Grocery Item Frequency Tracker was developed to automate the process of analyzing grocery sales data, making it easier to track how often specific items are sold. The project involved writing a program that reads a dataset containing item sales, processes the data, and generates a report with the frequency of each item. This solution is designed to save time and reduce errors when handling large datasets.

The program accepts input in the form of a CSV file containing sales data. After processing the file, it counts the occurrences of each grocery item and outputs a report listing the items and their frequencies. The program is structured to be easily modified and expanded in the future, allowing for enhancements such as error handling for malformed input files or support for real-time data processing.

During development, I focused on ensuring that the code was modular and easy to maintain, with each function handling a specific aspect of the process, such as reading input, counting item frequencies, and generating the final report. This approach makes the program adaptable for future updates and ensures that any new features can be added without disrupting the core functionality.

Looking forward, I plan to introduce more features such as CSV output generation for easy data export and adding error handling for invalid or corrupted input files. These improvements would increase the robustness and usability of the program, making it a more complete solution for grocery data analysis.
