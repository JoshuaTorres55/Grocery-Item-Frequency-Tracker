# Programing-Languages
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project involved developing a program that tracks and analyzes grocery item sales from an input file. The goal was to read, process, and output the frequency of items sold, solving the problem of manual tracking and providing a structured way to handle sales data efficiently.

What did you do particularly well?
I organized the code into modular functions, ensuring each function handled a specific task, like reading data or generating frequency outputs. This made the program easier to understand and debug. Additionally, I followed best practices for variable naming and comments, which enhanced code readability.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One area for improvement is error handlingâ€”specifically, adding checks for file existence and handling invalid data gracefully. These enhancements would make the code more robust and secure by preventing runtime errors and ensuring the program can handle unexpected inputs.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Parsing the input file and ensuring the data was correctly processed into a map structure was the most challenging part. I overcame this by referencing documentation on file streams and using debugging tools to test smaller portions of the code.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project reinforced my skills in file handling, working with data structures like maps, and designing modular code. These skills are highly transferable to other projects requiring data processing, database integration, or scalable program design.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments to make the code easy to read. I also wrote modular functions and avoided hardcoding values, which makes the program adaptable to changes in file paths or additional features in the future.
